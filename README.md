## Installation
Requires python 3. Install required python dependencies using requirements.txt
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Install PostgreSQL ([guide here for macOS](https://www.codementor.io/engineerapart/getting-started-with-postgresql-on-mac-osx-are8jcopb)), and create a user named admin

You'll need to create a `.env` file in the PennApps2018 folder with the following info

```
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=somethingrandom
DATABASE_URL=postgres://admin:password@localhost/pennapps
ALLOWED_HOSTS=.localhost
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID=
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET=

```
Where the spotipy info you get from signing up for the [spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/)

You can run the app locally with `python manage.py runserver`. To reset the database run `python manage.py flush` and to reset the cached login credentials delete `.spotipyoauthcache`

## What it does

Sonicswype is a tinder-inspired webapp that plays a snippet of a track to the user. Then, the user swipes left or right depending if they like the track. The next track is decided by using Spotifyâ€™s related artist function. Liked tracks are ultimately stored in a Spotify playlist.
